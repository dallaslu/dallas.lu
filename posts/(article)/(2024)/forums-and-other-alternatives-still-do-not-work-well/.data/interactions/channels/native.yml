    Pragmatic Play pushed the hit series to another level with the Super Scatter

    Key Numbers \r

    \ \r

    - Grid: 6x5, pay anywhere system \r

    - RTP: 96.5% \r

    - Variance: High \r

    - Mult symbols: up to 500x per symbol \r

    \ \r

    What Sets It Apart \r

    \ \r

    SS symbols activate direct payouts at the bonus trigger: \r

    \ \r

    - 1 SS symbol — 100x wager \r

    - 2 Super Scatters pays a solid 500x hit \r

    - 3 SS symbols awards 5,000x — big money \r

    - All four SS symbols awards an incredible 50,000x — jackpot level \r

    \ \r

    In Action \r

    \ \r

    Tumble mechanic makes each spin engaging — triggered symbols clear, new ones
    fall in. Multiplier symbols build up through tumbles. During free spins (15
    FS, can retrigger), mults build into a running total rather than resetting.
    \r

    \ \r

    Main game feels similar if you've played the original. The excitement moves
    to bonus triggers: can a Super Scatter land with the regular scatters? \r

    \ \r

    The Takeaway \r

    \ \r

    Identical core as the original release, higher ceiling. Worth trying if you
    enjoy high-potential variance with proven mechanics."
