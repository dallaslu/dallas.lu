It's 2008, start a blog to celebrate ....

A few days ago a mass text was sent:

> Thanks to all of you, I've finally said goodbye to being single in 2007 ！！！！  
> (followed by N line breaks)  
> I'm about to begin 2008 as a single .....  

After that, some people asked me whose girl was so unlucky to suffer; some people said I had to take a big breath to send a text message; some people called when they received the text message; some people said my spirit is commendable and keep up the good work and so on...

Goodbye, 2007!
